# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation was to create a web application to provide a clear and simple guide for new learners like myself with Web Development. I've learnt the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. Narrowing down what I've learnt into bullet points makes is a more efficient learning method. In the futuer, it can be used as a refresher.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
